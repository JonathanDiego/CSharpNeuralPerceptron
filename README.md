# CSharpNeuralPerceptron
A brief study on Neural Networks

Here are an implementation of a Neural Network Perceptron.

Some avaliable features are:
    * Save and load the trainning
    * A trained NN to classify digits from MINIST with 89% accuracy - 784 neurons on entry layer and 10 on the output layer
    * Activation functions: RELU, leakRELU, Sigmoid, Softmax
    * Loss cost fuctions: Cross Entropy, MSE
    * NeuralUtility: some functions to help in the study.
    * Convolutions: a start study on Convolutions - kernel filters
