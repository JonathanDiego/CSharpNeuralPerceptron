# CSharpNeuralPerceptron
A brief study on Neural Networks

Here are an implementation of a Neural Network Perceptron.

Some avaliable features are:

    => Save and load the trainning
    => A trained NN to classify digits from MINIST with 89% accuracy - 784 neurons on entry layer and 10 on the output layer
    => Activation functions: RELU, leakRELU, Sigmoid, Softmax
    => Loss cost fuctions: Cross Entropy, MSE
    => NeuralUtility: some functions to help in the study.
    => Convolutions: a start study on Convolutions - kernel filters
